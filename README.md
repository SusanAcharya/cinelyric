**CineLyric** is a mobile app that helps you find movies and music just by recalling a few words — whether it’s a line from a film or a lyric from a song. Type it in (or speak it out loud), and CineLyric digs through heaps of data to figure out what you’re talking about.

It’s like having that one friend who instantly knows the movie from a random quote — but powered by algorithms.

**Overview**

The app combines text-to-speech, natural language processing, and information retrieval techniques to identify and rank possible matches for any dialogue or lyric you input.

Behind the scenes, CineLyric uses:
